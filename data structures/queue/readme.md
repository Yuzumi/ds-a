# Queue

> In computer science, a queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection
> in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only)
> operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position,
> known as `enqueue`, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as `dequeue`.
> This makes the queue a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** data structure.

## Operations

- **enqueue** - adds a single or multiple items to the queue
- **dequeue** - retrieves & removes the next item of the queue
- **front** - returns item at front of queue without dequeueing
- **length** - returns current size of queue
- **isEmpty** - check if queue is empty
- **clear** - removes all the items of the queue
